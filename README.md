In the handle_connection function, we make a new BufReader instance, which wraps a reference to the stream. It adds buffering, meaning it reads a larger chunk of data into memory at once. http_request collects the lines of the request that the browser sends to our server in a vector. The lines method then splits the stream of data into a String whenever it sees a newline byte, and then each String is mapped to a Result. Because we're slacking on error handling for this one, we just put in unwrap so that if errors show up, we just stop the program. The browser signals the end of a HTTP request by sending two newline characters in a row, so if we get a line that is the empty string, that signifies one request from the stream. After all is done, we print out the result.
